= py-gpolyencode : python modules for Google Maps polyline encoding =

Python port of the Javascript Google Maps polyline encoder from Mark McClure, released under a BSD license. Both a pure python (gpolyencode) and a C++ extension (cgpolyencode) are implemented, with numerous unit tests.

== Requirements ==

  * Python >= 2.4
  * for the C++ extension, a compiler, python headers, C++ standard library, etc
  * to run the tests, SimpleJSON (Python < 2.6) and Nose >= 0.10

== Installing ==

=== Pure Python module (gpolyencode) ===

  $ sudo python python/setup.py install

If you have the Python `easy_install` utility available, you can also type the following to download and install in one step:

  $ sudo easy_install gpolyencode
  $ sudo easy_install --upgrade gpolyencode    # to force upgrading

=== C++ extension module module (cgpolyencode) ===

  $ sudo python cpp/setup.py install

If you have the Python `easy_install` utility available, you can also type the following to download and install in one step:

  $ sudo easy_install cgpolyencode
  $ sudo easy_install --upgrade cgpolyencode    # to force upgrading

== Documentation ==

  >>> import gpolyencode
  >>> encoder = gpolyencode.GPolyEncoder()
  # points are a sequence of (longitude,latitude) coordinate pairs
  >>> points = ((8.94328,52.29834), (8.93614,52.29767), (8.93301,52.29322), (8.93036,52.28938), (8.97475,52.27014),)
  >>> encoder.encode(points)
  {'points':'soe~Hovqu@dCrk@xZpR~VpOfwBmtG', 'levels':'PG@IP', 'zoomFactor':2, 'numLevels':18}

Once you have your dictionary, passing it through a JSON encoder and adding it to some HTML or Javascript should be a piece of cake. See the Google Maps API documentation for GPolyline and GPolygon, or Mark McClure's website for lots of examples.

The constructor takes several arguments:
  * `num_levels` specifies how many different levels of magnification the polyline will have. (default: 18)
  * `zoom_factor` specifies the change in magnification between those levels. (default: 2)
  * `threshold` indicates the length of a barely visible object at the highest zoom level. (default: 0.00001)
  * `force_endpoints` indicates whether or not the endpoints should be visible at all zoom levels. (default: True)

See http://facstaff.unca.edu/mcmcclur/GoogleMaps/EncodePolyline/description.html for more details on what these parameters mean and how to tweak them. The defaults are sensible for most situations.

The module cgpolyencode provides an identical interface to that of the gpolyencode module. Use of the gpolyencode.GPolyEncoder can be made more efficient (~40 times faster) by using the cgpolyencode.GPolyEncoder instead.

== Running the tests ==

The unit tests check compatibility with the original Javascript class by Mark McClure. There's a range of tests from simple encode-a-point tests through to 150K point lines.

1. install both the Python & the C++ modules
2. run:
     $ python tests/gpolyencode_tests.py -v
